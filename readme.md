# PSD to HTML w/ BOOTSTRAP

First attempt to convert a psd file to and html with consideration to bootstrap.


## Experience

In this experience, my partner and I were able to make almost one webpage, insert an image, manipulate text with css styling, and make the pafe responsive. We've also used some features froom bootstrap like navbars, and carousels.



## Problems

One major problem was getting around one set of codes with two minds; the organization of thoughts. Most of them were about which codes to use in a particular feature.



## Todos

With more time we could have finished the page, make it look more like the psd file, and could have done two pages rather than one.
